# Exercises 9

In this exercises we introduce classical machine learning algorithms for classifcation task (0R, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, knn, decision tree, random forest) and their implementations in scikit-learn library. We are trainnig and testing them on a 2D syntetic dataset in order to create better visualisations and better intuition about how these algorithms work. 

Check out official sckit-learn documentation (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).
