# Exercises 11

In this exercises we are implementing neural networks using tensorflow.keras API in order to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Files

- 'mnist/' - folder for the MNIST task (we worked on exerciese)
    - 'mnist_template.ipynb' - notebook with the template for this exercises
    - 'mnist_solution.ipynb' - notebook with the solution for this exercises
- 'nn_visulization.ipynb' - notebook with the visualization of the neural network decision boundaries (this notebook is not important for the tests, it is just for visualization purposes)
