# Exercises 4

In this exercises we continued to work on the problem of Romanian cities, now w
with informed search algorithms A* and Greedy Best First Search (GBFS).
Beside that, we also solved the word game problem using informed search algorithms.

## Files

- `exercises4.pdf` - contains the text of the problems for this week's exercises
- `RomanianMap/` - this directory contains solution for the first task of 
exercises. The base for this code is last week's solution `Week 03/RomanianMap/implementation/`
- `WordGame/` - this directory contains solution for the second task of the exercises. All files (for algorithm definition) except `main.py` and `problem_definition.py` are reused from the solution of the first task.
