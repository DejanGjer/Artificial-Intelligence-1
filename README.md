## Description

This github repository contains the exercises for the course Artificial Intelligence 1 at the Faculty of Sciences, UNS, Novi Sad.
For more information and materials from the course visit the 
[moodle page](https://moodle.pmf.uns.ac.rs/course/view.php?id=1631).

## Exercises

This repository will be updated with tasks from each weeks exercises after they are held.

### Week 1

In this exercises we went through some basic python syntax and data structures.

### Week 2

In this exercises we explained OOP in python and went through some basic usage examples. We also implemented interfaces and problem definition for the search
algorithms that we will be using in the next exercises.

### Week 3

In this exrcises we implemented uninformed search algorithms BFS, DFS, UCS in order to solve the problem of Romanian cities.

### Week 4
In this exercises we continued to work on the problem of Romanian cities, now w
with informed search algorithms A* and Greedy Best First Search (GBFS).
Beside that, we also solved the word game problem using informed search algorithms.

### Week 5
In this exercises we implemented the minimax algorithm for the game of Connect 4. We also implemented the alpha-beta pruning algorithm and limited depth of minimax in order to improve the performance of the algorithm.

### Week 6
In this exercises we are starting introduction to machine learning part of the course. 
First we setup the conda environment that we are going to use throughout the course and then we introduce jupyter notebooks and specifically it's extension for VS Code. After that we are learning numpy (library for scientific computing in python).

### Week 7
In this exercises we started learning pandas (library for data analysis in python and work with tabular data). 

### Week 8
In this exercises we are continuing to explore pandas and also starting with
some basic data visualizations using seaborn library.

### Week 9
In this exercises we introduce classical machine learning algorithms for classifcation task (0R, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, knn, decision tree, random forest) and their implementations in scikit-learn library. 

### Week 10
In this exercises we are solving the problem of binary classification on the Titanic dataset. Here we learn and implement preprocissing of the tabular datasets, train-test splits, k-fold cross validation, hyperparameter tuning and evaluation of the models.

### Week 11
In this exercises we are implementing neural networks using tensorflow.keras API in order to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Additional Problems

Contains some additional problems that can be useful for preparation for the first practical exam.

## First Practical Exam Materials

Contains availbale interfaces for the first practical exam. It also has the full solution and problem statement of the exam from November 2023.
