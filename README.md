## Exercises

This repository will be updated with tasks from each weeks exercises after they are held.

### Week 1

In this exercises we went through some basic python syntax and data structures.

### Week 2

In this exercises we explained OOP in python and went through some basic usage examples. We also implemented interfaces and problem definition for the search
algorithms that we will be using in the next exercises.

### Week 3

In this exrcises we implemented uninformed search algorithms BFS, DFS, UCS in order to solve the problem of Romanian cities.

### Week 4
In this exercises we continued to work on the problem of Romanian cities, now w
with informed search algorithms A* and Greedy Best First Search (GBFS).
Beside that, we also solved the word game problem using informed search algorithms.

### Week 5
In this exercises we implemented the minimax algorithm for the game of Connect 4.
