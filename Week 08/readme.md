# Exercises 8

In this exercises we are continuing to explore pandas and also starting with
some basic data visualizations using seaborn library.

Most of the materials for this exercises are from the [kaggle learn tutorial - pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) and [kaggle learn tutorial - data visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization).
